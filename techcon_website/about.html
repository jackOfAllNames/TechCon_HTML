        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
          TechCon began its journey in 2010 as a grassroots meetup of software
          engineers and tech hobbyists in San Francisco. What started as a
          modest gathering of 50 attendees has since transformed into a global
          platform attracting over 10,000 participants annually from 40+
          countries. Over the years, TechCon has become synonymous with
          cutting-edge innovation, bringing together developers, researchers,
          startups, and enterprise leaders to exchange ideas, launch new
          products, and build the future of technology. From the introduction of
          AI breakthroughs in 2015 to discussions on ethical technology and
          quantum computing in recent editions, TechCon has consistently set the
          pace for what's next in tech.
